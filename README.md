# Radio Telescope Control Simulator

This project is a Python-based simulator for controlling a radio telescope.
The goal is to model telescope motion, scheduling, and observation control.
This repository is part of my preparation for graduate studies in radio astronomy software.


Day 2: Implemented error-based convergence check and automated test

Day 3: Added smooth deceleration + precise target lock-in (all tests passing).

Day 4: Added command queue processing with sequential target execution (multi-target tests passing).
